<h2>About Me</h2>
    <h4>Rafael is an NYC native who has a passion for gathering data and analyzing it to find patterns that no one would have ever even thought existed.</h4>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="paragraph">I have been working in Benefits since 2019. And while I've highly enjoyed helping employees enroll in their company benefits, I am ready to pursue my passion in Data Analytics.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="paragraph">I first came across Data Analytics as an undergrad at Franklin & Marshall College where I conducted a real-word, 3-semester long study in developmental psychology. Gathering data, running it on SPSS, and interpreting p-values felt like a sweater that fit just right. And being flown out to Portland, OR to present this project at a conference felt even better!</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="paragraph">My interest in data analytics led me to pursue my Master's in Industrial/Organizational Psychology where I learned how to gather data from an organization's records and operations, and how to use analytic tools to find insights that inform business decisions. Since graduating in 2019, I've continued to expand my skill set by completing my Google Data Analytics Certificate that demonstrates my expertise in Excel, SQL, and Tableau.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="paragraph">I have been able to apply some of my analytics knowledge to my career, like when I've analyzed employee demographics and turnover; and made beautiful dashboards that helped HR leaders visualize my findings. I've also used my knowledge of V-lookups and Pivot Tables to keep HR databases up to date.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="paragraph">I made this online Portfolio as a way to show-case my skills and knowledge. So please check out my work if you haven't already. And if you like what you see feel free to reach out at the email and phone listed below!</p>
